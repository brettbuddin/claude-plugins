# Piano Chord Voicing Ideas

Suggest practical piano chord voicings tailored to musical context and the
player's goals.

## Workflow

1. Identify the chord or progression the user is asking about
2. Consider the harmonic context: genre, surrounding chords, voice leading
3. Determine the playing context: solo piano, with a band, comping behind a
   soloist, or arranging
4. Suggest multiple voicing options with trade-offs explained
5. Notate voicings clearly using the conventions below

## Notation Conventions

- Notate with octave numbers: `C3 E3 G3 B3`
- Indicate left hand (LH) and right hand (RH) distribution
- Example: LH `C2 G2` / RH `E4 B4 D5` = Cmaj9 spread voicing
- Spell out chord tones bottom-to-top, lowest pitch first
- Label each note's function: root (R), third (3), fifth (5), seventh (7),
  and extensions (9, 11, 13)
- Use standard note names with accidentals: `C`, `Db`, `F#`
- Use slash notation for inversions: `Cmaj7/E` (first inversion)

## Voicing Types

Use the descriptions below to select appropriate voicing types for the context.

### Close (Block) Voicing

All chord tones within a single octave. Dense, compact sound. Common in
big band arranging, pop comping, and hymn-style writing. On piano, typically
played with one hand in the middle register.

### Open Voicing

Chord tones spread across more than one octave. Created by displacing one or
more inner voices up or down an octave. More spacious and resonant than close
voicings. Requires two hands for comfortable execution.

### Drop 2

Start from a close voicing and drop the second note from the top down one
octave. Good voice leading in four-part writing. On piano, the dropped note
falls naturally into the left hand while the remaining three stay in the right.

### Drop 3

Drop the third note from the top down one octave. Wider spread than drop 2.
Creates a gap in the middle of the voicing that gives the chord an open,
orchestral quality.

### Drop 2+4

Drop the second and fourth notes from the top down one octave. Very wide
spread. Useful for lush, orchestral textures. Requires two hands spanning
a wide range.

### Shell Voicing

Root, third, and seventh only (omit the fifth). Minimal, functional voicing
that outlines chord quality clearly. Ideal for comping behind soloists, duo
settings, or when leaving room for other instruments. Typically played with
the left hand alone.

Two common shapes:

- **Root-3-7**: R on bottom, third and seventh close together above
- **Root-7-3**: R on bottom, seventh below the third (inverted shell)

These two shapes alternate naturally through ii-V-I progressions: the third
of one chord resolves down by half step to the seventh of the next.

### Rootless Voicing

Omit the root (typically handled by a bassist). Built from the third or
seventh up. Standard in jazz piano comping. Two common forms:

- **Type A**: 3, 5, 7, 9 (built up from the third)
- **Type B**: 7, 9, 3, 5 (built up from the seventh)

Type A and Type B alternate smoothly through ii-V-I progressions with minimal
hand movement. Play these in the C3 to C5 range to avoid muddiness below or
thinness above.

### Quartal Voicing

Built in stacked fourths (perfect or augmented). Ambiguous, modern sound.
Characteristic of McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock, and modal jazz. Works well
over sus chords, minor chords, and modal contexts. Typically voiced in the
right hand, sometimes with a bass note or fifth in the left.

### Cluster Voicing

Notes packed tightly, often within a third or fourth. Dissonant, colorful.
Used for textural effects, film scoring, and contemporary jazz. On piano,
can involve playing adjacent white or black keys with the palm or fist for
extreme clusters, or carefully selected seconds for controlled color.

### Spread (Wide) Voicing

Large intervals between voices (tenths, compound intervals). Orchestral,
lush quality. Effective for ballads, intros, and endings. Left hand takes
a low bass note; right hand voices the chord a tenth or more above. The
gap in the middle creates a sense of space and depth.

### Upper Structure Triad

A triad (major or minor) played in the right hand over a bass note or shell
in the left hand, implying extensions and alterations. For example, a D major
triad over a C7 shell yields C13(#11). Bright, clear way to voice complex
chords without cluttering the voicing.

Common upper structure pairings over dominant 7th chords:

- **bII triad** over dom7: implies b9, #11, 7
- **II triad** over dom7: implies 9, #11, 13
- **bIII triad** over dom7: implies #9, 5, b7
- **bVI triad** over dom7: implies b9, 3, b13
- **VI triad** over dom7: implies #9 (enharmonic b3 of triad), #5, 7 (enharmonic root of triad)... actually implies 9, b13, R...

### "So What" Voicing

A specific quartal structure: three stacked perfect fourths with a major third
on top. Named after the voicing Bill Evans used on Miles Davis's "So What."
For Dm11: `D3 G3 C4 F4 A4`. The intervallic uniformity of the fourths
obscures whether the chord is minor, sus, or purely modal. Rotating the
structure to start on different scale degrees yields fresh colors across a
mode. Works well over modal vamps, pedal tones, and static harmony where
functional root motion is absent.

### Quintal Voicing

Built in stacked fifths (perfect or diminished). More open and hollow than
quartal voicings. Because a fifth doesn't strongly imply major or minor
quality, quintal voicings float between tonalities. For example, `C3 G3 D4`
could belong to C major, G major, D minor, or A minor depending on context.
Effective over drones, in modal jazz, and in film scoring where harmonic
neutrality is desired. Typically voiced across two hands due to the wide
intervals.

### Constant Structure Voicing

A fixed chord shape (e.g., major 7th, minor 7th, or sus voicing) moved in
parallel, often by steps or chromatic motion, regardless of the underlying
key center. Because the shape stays the same, each transposition implies a
different scale or mode, creating harmonic ambiguity and a sense of
"floating" tonality. Characteristic of Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and
post-bop writing. Example: moving a Bbmaj7 shape up in whole steps
(Bbmaj7, Cmaj7, Dmaj7) over a static bass note produces shifting color
without functional resolution.

### Slash / Hybrid Voicing

A triad or four-note structure in the right hand over an unrelated bass note
in the left hand. Goes beyond simple inversions: the bass note recontextualizes
the upper chord, creating ambiguity about the true root and function. For
example, `G/A` could imply A9sus, A Dorian, or a G chord with a non-functional
bass, depending on what surrounds it. Useful for:

- **Sus/modal colors**: `Eb/F` as Fsus or F Mixolydian
- **Bass line stepwise motion**: `C/D`, `C/E`, `C/F` creating a rising bass
  under a static triad
- **Bitonal tension**: `F#/C` where neither note is "wrong" but the
  relationship is unresolved

### Polychord Voicing

Two recognizable chords stacked, one in each hand, implying a single complex
harmony. More general than upper structure triads (which place a triad over
a shell); polychords can combine two triads, two seventh chords, or any
pairing. The listener perceives two competing tonal centers simultaneously,
producing a "which key are we in?" tension. For example, `E major / C major`
(LH `C3 E3 G3` / RH `E4 G#4 B4`) yields a Cmaj7(#5) or an ambiguous
C/E bitonal sound. Polychords are common in Stravinsky, Bartok, and modern
jazz composers like Wayne Shorter.

### Stride Voicing

Left hand alternates between a low bass note (beat 1, beat 3) and a
mid-register chord (beat 2, beat 4). The chord on the off-beats is typically
a close-position triad or shell in the C3-C4 range. Right hand plays melody
or improvised lines above. Classic technique from Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson,
and Thelonious Monk.

## Register Guidelines

- Avoid voicing too many notes below C3; intervals smaller than a sixth
  become muddy in the low register
- The sweet spot for chord voicings is C3 to C5
- Bass notes (roots, fifths) work well in the C1 to C3 range
- Upper extensions and color tones are clearest in the C4 to C6 range
- Solo piano benefits from a wide spread (bass note in octave 1-2, chord
  in octave 3-5) to fill the frequency spectrum
- In a band with a bassist, avoid doubling the bass; keep both hands in
  the C3 to C5 range

## Context-Specific Guidance

### Solo Piano

- Keep the root in the bass on beat 1 to anchor tonality
- Use spread voicings or stride to cover the full range of the instrument
- Shell voicings in the left hand with extensions in the right hand provide
  clarity and color simultaneously
- Pedal use: sustain pedal can connect voicings, but change it on each
  new harmony to avoid blurring

### Comping (with Bass and Drums)

- Rootless voicings are the standard; the bassist covers the root
- Stay in the middle register (C3 to C5) to avoid clashing with the bass
  or stepping on the soloist
- Leave rhythmic space; comping is about punctuation, not constant chording
- Mix Type A and Type B rootless voicings for smooth voice leading

### Comping (Duo with Singer or Soloist, No Bass)

- Shell voicings in the left hand to define harmony
- Right hand can double the melody, add fills, or play upper extensions
- Include the root to ground the harmony since there is no bassist

### Ballad Playing

- Spread voicings and upper structure triads for lush, full sound
- Arpeggiate voicings rather than playing them as blocks for a gentler texture
- Use the sustain pedal generously but change with each harmony
- Inner voice movement (chromatic lines within held chords) adds interest

### R&B, Gospel, and Neo-Soul

- Close-position voicings with added 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths
- Chromatic approach chords (slide into the target chord from a half step
  below or above)
- Stacked thirds with extensions create the characteristic lush sound
- Left hand plays octave roots or root-fifth patterns

## Voice Leading Principles

When suggesting voicings for a progression, follow these guidelines:

- **Minimize motion**: Move each voice to the nearest chord tone in the next
  chord. Prefer stepwise or common-tone connections.
- **Preserve common tones**: If two chords share a note, keep it in the same
  voice.
- **Contrary motion**: When the bass moves up, try moving upper voices down
  (and vice versa) for independence.
- **Guide tones**: The third and seventh of each chord form a voice-leading
  thread through a progression. In a ii-V-I, the seventh of ii (C in Dm7)
  becomes the third of V (C in G7), and the seventh of V (F in G7) resolves
  to the third of I (E in Cmaj7). Highlight these connections.
- **Smooth top line**: The top note of each voicing forms a melody heard by
  the listener. Aim for a smooth or intentional contour in this top voice.

## Response Format

When presenting voicings:

1. State the chord symbol and context
2. Offer 2-4 voicing options, each labeled by type
3. For each voicing:
   - Show the notes with LH/RH distribution and octave numbers
   - List each note's function (R, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.)
   - Briefly explain when/why to use it
4. If the user gave a progression, show voice leading across the changes
5. Mention any trade-offs: playability, fullness, clarity, genre fit
